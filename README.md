# terminal-chess
Play chess in the terminal!

<b>Note</b>: </i>This program only work on Unix-based system as of right now as it uses the Python `curses` library.</i>

You can check out playing against the computer in the branch [CPP-Minimax](https://github.com/vincentarcuri/terminal-chess/tree/CPP-Minimax). However, it runs pretty slow on a low depth, so some changes will need to be made before it becomes the main branch, and it has not been fully tested.
